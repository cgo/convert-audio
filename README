This is a command line tool to convert audio files using ffmpeg and lame.
You need both installed, as well as the /spawn/ Haskell library.
The number of concurrent processes can be chosen from the command line,
and currently the program can convert between ogg, mp3, and flac, with fixed bitrate.
There are not many command line options to keep things simple, if you need more, let me know
or add them yourself.
The used ffmpeg and lame command lines can also be printed using --print.

Compile with:
 $> ghc -threaded convert-audio.hs

-- Christian
